# Authenticated Bot
Sample repository adding AAD v1 authentication to a Bot Framework (v3) bot
This project was made as a playing ground for exploring and learning NodeJS and Javascript. 

## Getting started
In order to try out this code, you'll have to: 
* Create a bot in the Azure Portal, 
* Register an application in AAD for the authentication to work
* Enter the ApplicationId and password for the bot, as well as the application ID from AAD into your .env file

Once done, you should be able to start playing around with the code.
